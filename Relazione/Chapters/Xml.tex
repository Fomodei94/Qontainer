\section{Saving and loading from file}

Loading items from file into Qontainer or saving items from Qontainer to file is possible thanks to a custom utility file, named \emph{LoadSave.cpp}, that contains the functions needed by the application. The chosen format for keeping data safe and persistent even after program quits is \emph{JSON}. The file, named \emph{savedLibrary.json}, already contains a few default objects and is placed in \emph{C++/} folder.\\
Using these functionalities is incredibly simple and intuitive, it takes only to click on the dedicated buttons on bottom-right corner, as shown in picture:
