\section{Polymorphism}

Pointers belonging to application's main custom container (\emph{Qontainer<VideoFile*>}) can assume polymorphic behavior as they can be used to interact with child classes' objects.\\
RTTI\footnote{Run-Time Type Identification} and polymorphic behavior can be found in these points of the software:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{View/modifyWidget.cpp:} into \emph{activateFields()} function, depending on the object pointed by \emph{VideoFile *vid} GUI widgets dynamically change their state.
\item \textbf{View/modifyWidget.cpp:} into \emph{confirmModify()} function, depending on the object pointed by \emph{VideoFile *vid} container objects are dynamically modified.
\item \textbf{Model/Qontainer.h:} into searching functions such as \emph{searchByDirector()}, searching fields are dynamically chosen at run-time, depending on the pointed object.
\item \textbf{LoadSave.cpp:} into \emph{saveToFile()} function, object type to be saved in JSON file is identified by RTTI.
\item \textbf{View/MainWindow.cpp:} into \emph{windowSelector()} function, QPushButto *button pointer recognize at run-time which type of widget to create, thanks to RTTI.
\end{itemize}
