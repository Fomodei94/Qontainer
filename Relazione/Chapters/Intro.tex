\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Compiling instructions}

Project compilation requires a different project file (.pro) from the standard one. The right Qontainer.pro file is already given in the folder\footnote{In case of need, the command to generate the .pro file is: \textit{qmake -project "QT+=widgets" "CONFIG+=c++11"}}, so the only commands to invoke are \\ 
\textit{qmake} \\
\textit{make}
